<p><h1>Subject line: Restart your resolutions with the 10 Days of Coloring challenge</h1>
The weather is changing and your schedule is too. Depending on where you live, you can finally go outside without a jacket or even sport your favorite dress. This can be an exciting time of year - but it can also bring on self-reflection. You may have had many plans for 2019 and feel like the months crept up on you. Or maybe you aren’t a resolution maker but want to be someone who is.</p>

<p>A new season is the perfect time for a fresh start. That’s why we’re introducing the 10 Days of Coloring challenge. This month we’re going to cover different topics that will inspire you to break out your coloring book. You can use these emails as a reminder to set aside some time for yourself and get creative.</p>

<p>It can be hard to fit in the things you enjoy and care about. What’s great about this challenge is it’s just about dedicating time to something you love. Join us in restarting your self care: by the end of it you’ll have ten gorgeous drawings and over a week of commitment to your goal. This will propel you forward to tackle even more goals through the year. See how much can change in just ten days!</p>
