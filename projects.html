        The Baltimore Office of Promotion & the Arts was looking to close the gap between public art and public citizens with a mobile application that would help residents propose murals in their own communities. When they approached my Interaction Design class to contribute ideas, my group had a few key objectives for the app: to let users quickly mock up a proposed mural, to inform them about the BOPA approval process, and for the entire experience to be accessible to users who aren’t involved in the arts. With my team members (Shannon Hart, Dawn Hubbs, Amy Brown), I used heuristic research to prototype screens for an app we called “Baltimore MuralArts.”
