       When the Maryland Higher Education Commission approached our class to redesign their IA, my group (Kat Martineau, Jared Rixter) saw an opportunity to reposition MHEC as the stateâ€™s premiere higher education access resource. I took a leading role in developing personas, scenarios, and brand strategy to reflect the key themes of <i>access, success,</i> and <i>innovation.</i>

        The Baltimore Office of Promotion & the Arts was looking to close the gap between public art and public citizens with a mobile app that lets residents suggest murals in their own communities. My group (Shannon Hart, Dawn Hubbs, Amy Brown) designed our proposed app from low to high fidelity, with an emphasis on heuristic research and microinteractions.

       My Research Methods class conducted usability research on Bandit, a software that naturalists use to submit their data to the USGS Bird Banding Lab. With my group members (Dawn Hubbs, Rebecca Slavin) I collected user data, prepared and presented client-facing materials, and led remote interviews with birders across the country.

       For my coursework in HCI I designed a case study based on nudging behavior in a defined user population. I started by researching challenges in the area of voice UI. I discovered that, despite their popularity, Alexa and Google Home are underutilized when it comes to online shopping. Using concepts from our work on influence, persuasion and perception, I proposed a solution that uses light and sound to encourage voice purchases.
