       As the state of Maryland’s higher education coordinating board, The Maryland Higher Education Commission aims to broaden horizons and help Marylanders down the path to higher education. When they approached our Information Architecture class to help redesign their IA, my group (Kat Martineau, Jared Rixter) saw an opportunity to reposition MHEC as Maryland’s premiere higher education access resource. I took in leading role in developing personas, scenarios, and brand strategy that reflects the key themes of <i>access, success,</i> and <i>innovation.</i>

        The Baltimore Office of Promotion & the Arts was looking to close the gap between public art and public citizens with a mobile application that would help residents propose murals in their own communities. When they approached my Interaction Design class to contribute ideas, my group had a few key objectives for the app: to let users quickly mock up a proposed mural, to inform them about the BOPA approval process, and for the entire experience to be accessible to users who aren’t involved in the arts. With my team members (Shannon Hart, Dawn Hubbs, Amy Brown), I used heuristic research to prototype screens for an app we called “Baltimore MuralArts.”

       For my Humans, Computers, and Cognition class I was tasked with designing a case study that sought to influence a behavior in a defined user population. I researched design problems in the area of voice UI and discovered that, despite their popularity, Alexa and Google Home are underutilized when it comes to online shopping. Using concepts from our coursework on influence, persuasion and perception, I proposed a design solution that uses light and sound to encourage voice purchases.
