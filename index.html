      <p class="h1">I'm Katelyn Greller.</p>
      <p>I’m a philosophy B.A. seeking opportunities in UX design and UX writing. I became interested in human-computer interaction when I started thinking about the role of technology in my life and the ethical imperatives posed by persuasive design. As a student of User Experience I’ve had the opportunity to contribute to projects for the U.S. Geological Survey, Baltimore Office of the Promotion of the Arts, and Maryland Higher Education Commission. I’m obsessed with Post-It notes, pencils and pens.</p>
