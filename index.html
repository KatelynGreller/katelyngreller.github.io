      <p class="h1">I'm Katelyn Greller.</p>
      <p>I’m a philosophy and UX grad seeking opportunities in NYC. I was drawn to a career in UX when I started thinking about the ethics of persuasive design. I love finding the narrative in design problems be it through user journeys or copywriting. I also blog about tech <a class="link"  href="https://medium.com/@katelyn.greller" target="_blank">here.</a> I’m obsessed with Post-It notes, pencils and pens.</p>

       <a name="MHEC"><p class="name">MHEC Information Architecture</p></a>
       When the Maryland Higher Education Commission approached our class to redesign their IA, my group saw an opportunity to reposition MHEC as the state’s premiere higher education access resource. I took a leading role in developing personas, scenarios, and brand strategy that reflect the key themes of <i>access, success,</i> and <i>innovation.</i>

        The Baltimore Office of Promotion & the Arts was looking to close the gap between public art and public citizens with a mobile app that lets residents suggest murals in their own communities. My group prototyped our proposed app from low to high fidelity with an emphasis on industry best practice.

        <p class="name">HCI Case Study</p>
      From researching challenges in the area of voice UI I discovered that digital assistants are underutilized for online shopping. Using concepts from my coursework on influence, persuasion and perception, I proposed a solution that uses light and sound to encourage voice purchases.
